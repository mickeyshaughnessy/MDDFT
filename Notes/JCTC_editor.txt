Dear Dr. Jones:

Thank you for your recent manuscript submission to the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation.   So far we have received only one review.  The reviewer has raised serious questions that must be addressed. 

If you feel that you can correct these problems, and choose to substantially revise your paper, please provide me upon resubmission with a detailed explanation of your changes and a point-by-point response to the reviewersâ€™ concerns. Your revised paper will be sent out for further review.

Make sure that the manuscript you submit in ACS Paragon Plus does not have any colored or highlighted text. You are welcome to submit a separate file with highlighted text that reflects the changes of the revised manuscript. This marked manuscript should be uploaded electronically in the File Upload section "Supporting Information for Review Only".

For guidelines on Table of Contents/Abstract Graphics, including instructions and specifications, please review the following document available at http://pubs.acs.org/paragonplus/submission/toc_abstract_graphics_guidelines.pdf.
